A low oil map that is easy to play!
- Friendly terrain: Each team has 3 players and 2 choke points. This simple design provides a beginner level of map complexity. The middle players can create imbalance and generate winning opportunities.
- Relaxed oil control: Each player has 4 oils that are easily destroyed, but hard to take. Failure to defend oils is punished, but only lightly.
