A very exaggerated map when it comes to defense or "balance" which practically doesn't exist. 
I recommend playing on one of the 4 teams in Team 2, 3, 4, 5 against teams 1, 0 or vice versa.

Info about all teams:
Team 0 "Nexus" - Insane Oil, Extreme Defenses 
Team 1 "Collective" - Mid-High Oil, High Defenses
Team 2 "Beta" - Medium Oil, Medium Defenses
Team 3 "New Paradigm" - Medium Oil, Medium Defenses
Team 4 "Alpha" - Medium Oil, Medium Defenses
Team 5 "The Project" - Mid-High Oil, Mid-High Oil

Also i didn't create this map, but I edited it. The original map is called 'WorldDomV31' 
and it was created by user Micah Fonken.
